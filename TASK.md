# Storytel Backend Coding Challenge

Welcome, as part of your interview process please complete the following technical task. Your
code will be shared with the team and form the basis of a technical discussion. We conduct these
tests in preference to live-coding during interviews, finding that we learn a lot more from a
discussion of code.

## Task

Design and build a RESTful API to serve as the backend for a public message board. It should
support the following features:
- A client can create a message in the service
- A client can modify their own messages
- A client can delete their own messages
- A client can view all messages in the service

Use an in-memory solution for storing any data for this service. Consider the appropriate HTTP
verbs, headers and responses to use.

You should also include tests to assert the correctness of your solution.
If you wish to show off your fullstack skills, you are welcome to include a UI over the API, but this is
optional.

The complete solution should include a README that describes how to build and run the solution.
Please either share the code with us in a public source repository or via email in a zip.

## Technical Details

Please choose between our core languages of Java, C#, F# or Go, and your own choice of
frameworks/libraries to help implement the web layer and testing.

Ensure the project is easily built with a common build system for the chose ecosystem.

Consider including a Dockerfile if you wish to demonstrate your knowledge of image building
